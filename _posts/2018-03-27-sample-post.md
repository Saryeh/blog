I have been finalizing my mockups and trying to achieve the image Im going for as well as put together the code for the pages. I will be creating a carousel image flow for my food page where you drag between illustrations to learn more about the content. Also for the opening page if you click left or right on the teabag tag you can choose which page you want to go to. Still need to tweak the blog page which im still not satisifed about and figure out how to integrate more information without it getting to hard to navigate and confusing.
