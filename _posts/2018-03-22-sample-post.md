I am going to be creating a website which focuses on the topic of health, wellness and beauty in a comedic and millenial way. Alot of websites that talk about this topic follow strict design rules and are not playful with dislpay and intercations. While my website will be educational it will also be playful in order to convey these lessons in an easy way to digest. The information will be sourced from certified practioners, who go by the tag name Organic Olivia and Medical Medium. The images will be sourced from artists for example Chloe Wise who's projects center around food. I might do a photoshoot of my own for the images of the food mimicing her style If I am able to gather the materials. My typography is inspired by Glossier and other brands that have this very retro or organic aesthetic that doesnt conform to the usual perception of a display font. I will also be creating a page where you can buy artwork, and books that ahave imagery created on the website so the wellness and health aspects acts as a jumping off point for artwork. My central idea is practicing mindesfullness in a healthy and fun way.
