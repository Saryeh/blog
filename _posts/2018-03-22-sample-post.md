"It was a process!" India Hicks exclaims over the phone. She's referring to her latest book, India Hicks: A Slice of England, but she could just as easily be discussing what it took to build her English country home. This manor, a Georgian-style country retreat located in bucolic Oxfordshire, is in fact the partial subject of India's new book. The other points of focus are her infamous family homes.

Because while India is now known for her own eponymous lifestyle business, she comes from storied British lineage. Her mother is Lady Pamela Hicks, Prince Philip's first cousin, while her father, David Nightingale Hicks, was a noted interiors and landscape designer. It comes as no huge surprise then that when it came time for India to build her own English retreat, she was repeatedly inspired by her own heritage.
