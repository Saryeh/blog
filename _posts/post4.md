So I figured out how to code the opening page however it didnt turn out the way I imagined  in my mock sketches and its way too complicated. It has too many steps and needs to be simplified to two actions only. Also I am working on a carousel for my food explanation page using code from slick. The navigation for the pages away from the opening one is established but needs changes in font and color.
