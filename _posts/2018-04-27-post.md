Ive been refining the navigation system page which is finally done and had some trouble creating a filter for the carousel since the first link would work unlike the other two. However after working on it in class with Dan it seems to be working. I need to refine the pages and finalize my opening page to create an easy transition into the wesbite. So the foundation of the wesbite has been layed out and now it needs final touches.
