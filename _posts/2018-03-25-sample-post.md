title: SECOND POST

I have been working on branding and designing the aestheic, which will be feminine and targeting young people between the ages of 18-28. It will be quircky and heavily inspired by the artist Chloe Wise whose artwork is centered around food and so the imagery will stem from that. I am between two display fonts of Wavehaus which is sans serif and 'Casual', which is a serif typeface. For coding I have been working on the opening page where the title revive fades in however the portals that act as the navigation menu are a work in progress. When you hover they will emerge and you click to go to another page. Also the carousel that i intended to be an arc is difficult to make so instead I will change the size of the images to create an impression of persepctive.
